# Tensorflow-Mobile-Face-Detection
 After the release of Tensorflow Lite on Nov 14th, 2017 which made it easy to develop and deploy Tensorflow models in mobile and embedded devices.There are many pre-trained models available for training your own set of images .In this project we developed a model using ssd-mobillnet and proposed a hypothesis that this model can also be used for facial Recognition .We trained the model using tensorflow object detection api .Then the inferenced model is deployed to a android app using Tensorflow android .Now this module can embedded with any of your app as a feature for facial recognition.
